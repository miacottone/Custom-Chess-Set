# Custom-Chess-Set
Designed 6 custom chess pieces meant to meet a personally chosen theme (symbols in Greek mythology) and assembled one side of a chess board using these pieces in SolidWorks. This project was created under the constraints of an assignment in my Cornerstone of Engineering 2 course and met all the project requirements.
